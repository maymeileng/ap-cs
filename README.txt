Progress Report #2: (This is not a readme that fulfills the documentation standard because I am not officially
turning in the project yet) So far, I have accomplished creating the outer permanent fences, and also the 20
randomly places interior fences. I have also created 12 randomly placed mhos. I am currently trying to figure out
a way to structure the code or write a separate method that can be implemented so that the interior fences and 
the mhos won't overlap each other, since right now I have that problem. I am also currently still researching
how to assign a control with a key on the keyboard so that I can make a player move around on the screen. My next
steps are to solve the overlapping problem and to also create a player that can be moved through the keyboard.
